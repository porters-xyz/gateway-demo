# Porters App ID

Use of this API requires a Porters App to be set up in the Porters backend. The App Id can then be passed as the `portersAppId` parameter.

Since this serice calls multiple chains, it is advisable not to set up any rules that limit chain usage on the App Id that will be used for this API.
