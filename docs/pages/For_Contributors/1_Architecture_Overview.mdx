# Overview of RPC Gateway Architecture

A few changes to the initial architectures are needed.

- some services are external that were initially conceptualised as internal
- changes to the payment infrastructure
- the data flow should be described

Generally the data flows from the frontend to the backend and then to the schema.

The frontend and the backend manage access to accounts for setting up the database. A redis database primarily caches postgress calls, but also usage is being cached and is being updated in chunks to the postgress database.

- future enhancement may include a flow chart
- postgress is the canonical data store for all bits
- frontend calls the backend, which in turn alters the postgress for configuring the proxy

- smart contracts are burning tokens
- event watcher for looking for these events and updating the account
