# Overview of RPC Gateway Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the RPC Gateway with recent changes and data flow descriptions.

## Changes to Initial Architectures

- **External Services**: Some services initially conceptualized as internal are now considered external.
- **Payment Infrastructure**: Changes have been made to the payment infrastructure.
- **Data Flow**: The data primarily flows from the frontend to the backend and then to the schema.

## Data Management

- **Account Management**: Frontend and backend manage access to accounts for setting up the database.
- **Caching**: Redis database primarily caches PostgreSQL calls, including usage data, which is periodically updated in chunks to the PostgreSQL database.

## Future Enhancements

- **Flow Chart**: Future enhancements may include the addition of a flow chart to visually represent the data flow and interactions.
- **Canonical Data Store**: PostgreSQL serves as the canonical data store for all information.
- **Configuration Updates**: Frontend calls the backend to alter PostgreSQL for configuring the proxy.

## Smart Contracts and Event Watcher

- **Token Burning**: Smart contracts are responsible for burning tokens.
- **Event Monitoring**: An event watcher continuously monitors these events and updates the account accordingly.
