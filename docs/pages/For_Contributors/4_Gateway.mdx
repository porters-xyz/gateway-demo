# Gateway Documentation

The Gateway first and foremost relies on the `net/http` library and its `ReverseProxy` functionality.

As middleware plugins are injected. These implement rules for proxyiing or not proxy. 

For any contributor looking to contribute, plugins are a viable path for getting started. They are located in the **plugins packages**.
