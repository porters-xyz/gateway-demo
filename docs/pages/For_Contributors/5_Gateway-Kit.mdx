# Gateway Kit

## Introduction

This page documents our usage of the gateway kit. More thorough documentation is available at the [Gateway Kit documentation]().

## Description of our implementation

We are proxing to the Gateway Kit. The Gateway Kit, in turn coordinates traffic with the POKT Network, i.e. selecting nodes to route traffic to based on the alocated [app stakes](). The private keys from the app stakes are imported to the Gateway Kit, which distributes POKT-specific traffic among the staked nodes according to the app stakes, latency, and available nodes.

Furthermore, the gateway kit manages the quality of services and the pool of nodes on the POKT network. In short, it tracks connections between app stakes and nodes and distributes traffic among them.

## Our usage

We included a Docker image of the gateway kit and included it in our repository. Thus, the gateway kit is not built from source.
