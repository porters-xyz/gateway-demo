# Postgres Schema

## Description

It is the data contract between the gateway and the portal.
Any change to the schema must be coordinated between the portal and the gateway.
It is a shared component between the portal and the gateway, as such connecting the two components.
We put it in the `services/postgres` directory so neither codebase feels it has direct control.

Schemas are managed by **Prisma object relational model (ORM)**. It allows to generate object models for the schemas.
You can run `just generate` to generate the javascript code for interacting with the database.
In addition changes to the schema can be pushed to the database with `just migrate`.

## Functionality

The schema consists of several tables.
There is a conceptual partition in the schema based on whether the gateway proxy directly interfaces with it.
There are portal-specific tables and some tables which are shared between the gateway and the portal.
Tables that are not interfacing with the gateway are frontend-specific and can be modified without the need to coordinate with the golang packages.

### Shared Tables

- **Tenant**:
    - created by the portal, apps can be attached to it
    - stores and tracks the relay balance
- **App**:
    - application table, managed by the portal
    - each app represents an set of endpoints for the enabled chains
- **AppRule**:
    - app rules add security or constraints on the endpoints
- **RuleType**:
    - types of app rules supported by the gateway
- **PaymentLedger**:
    - updated and managed by the event watcher
- **RelayLedger**:
    - updated by the gateway as relays are consumed
- **Product**:
    - lookup table for endpoint
    - contains the supported chains for the gateway
    - maps the chain name to the POKT identifier
    - enables per product usage tracking

### Portal-only Tables

- **User**:
    - stores user and session information
- **Org**:
    - for future use
    - allows multiple users to share a `Tenant`
- **Enterprise**:
    - for future use
    - an enterprise can have multiple tenants and organisations
    - since balances are managed at the tenant level, allows multiple cost centers
