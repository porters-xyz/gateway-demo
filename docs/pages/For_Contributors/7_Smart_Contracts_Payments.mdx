# Smart Contracts

## ERC-20 Token `PORTR`

It is a standard ERC-20 smart contract with a few additions, namely:

- open mint with a fixed price, which is maintained by Chainlink.
    - the smart contract on Taiko Mainnet is using PYTH data feed through the Chainlink interface
    - it allows for minting by sending the native token as the payable, the rate of which is set by the Chainlink price feed
- admin mint is only called by the owner to mint without having to pay
    - this is used for internal usage and enterprise-onboarding
- apply to account function
    - initiates a burn and emits an event, which is used to increase the account balance within the gateway
- sweep and sweep token
    - allows the operator to withdraw token balances of the contract, both native and ERC-20, sor settling internal accounts
    - this enables coverage of POKT relay costs
    - it completes the lifecycle of the smart contract

## PYTH Integration

The Taiko deployment of the smart contract has a dependency of the PYTH-wrapper for Chainlink. It has been deployed by us, but the code-base is not maintained by PORTERS. The wrapper is then connected to our implementation.

A [script]() for deploying this wrapper exists and has to be modified for deploying any other price feed.
