# PORTERS Integration with POKT

We are using a script by Nodies for the app stakes, which can be found [here](). It is a simple node script, which walks you through the app stake process.

One sets up a file with the private keys for accounts that contain unstaked POKT. The private key goes into the input directory. Then the script is run.

The inputs are the POKT nodes, which is required to do the RPC calls.

## Prompts

- POKT node, URL of the node the script is going to call to
- Chain IDs, a CSV of the chains you intend to stake to. It can be a list of one to fifteen chain IDs
- selector for POKT Mainnet and POKT Testnet
- amount of POKT to stake per account and chain
    - mono relays are split across chains


Thereafter, the script verifies the prompts. The script then sends the POKT to stake.
