# Gateway Documentation

This document provides an overview of the gateway architecture and functionality used in the PORTERS portal.

## Overview

The gateway primarily relies on the [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) library and its `ReverseProxy` functionality.
Requests are handled by [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), mapping paths to the reverse proxy.

## Reverse Proxy and Middleware

Inside the reverse proxy, middleware runs and hosts logic for allowing or denying requests in addition to modifying aspects of the request (headers, error codes, etc).
These middleware plugins are inserted into the request lifecycle, implementing rules for proxying or rejecting requests.
Contributors can start by exploring plugins located in the **plugins** package.

## Plugins Package

The `main.go` file configures the server and allows adding plugins to the registry.
Contributors can add new logic by providing new plugins.
These plugins are essential for customizing gateway behavior.

The plugin interface is defined as:

```go
type Plugin interface {
    Name() string
    Key() string
    Load()
}
```

`Name()` is just the user-friendly name by which to describe the plugin.
`Key()` is used to avoid collisions between Plugins, any cache data specific to a plugin should be prefixed with `Key()`.
`Load()` is called on application start to perform any steps needed to initialize the plugin

There are two additional sub-interfaces which are called for each request.
`PreHandler` introduces a function `HandleRequest(*http.Request) error` which can be implemented to be called before requests are forwarded to the POKT network.
This should be used to reject requests and make any precondition checks.
`PostHandler` introduces a function `HandleResponse(*http.Response) error` which may be implemented to be called after the Response from the gateway server.
It should be used to modify the response or clean up any errant responses.
In either case, an `error` may be returned which will reflect in the HTTP response.

### Lifecycle Management

This gateway introduces the concept of a lifecycle, where each stage must be fulfilled by a plugin for the request to be considered valid.
Plugins are not required to fulfill any lifecycle stages, but may fulfill several.
This concept guides the development and integration of plugins into the gateway architecture.

Currently there are four stages:
- `Auth`
- `AccountLookup`
- `BalanceCheck`
- `RateLimit`

## Proxy Package

The primary package in this program is the `proxy` package.
This defines the above `Plugin` type and calls it as part of the request lifecycle.
The proxy can be started as it is in the `gateway.go` file by calling `Start()` and requests will be proxyed to the gateway server defined by the environment variable `PROXY_TO` according to the established usage pattern.

## Database Package

The `db` package contains logic for interactions between Redis and PostgreSQL, handling data storage and retrieval.
Redis acts as a pass-through cache with a few additional features.
The goal is to keep all database specific interaction in this package (`go-redis` and `pq`).

## Utils Package

The `utils` package consists of small utility packages, providing helper functions and tools for various tasks.
- `gatewaykit.go` defines `Target` which builds the URL to proxy to
- `rate.go` defines the encoding of rate limits using `ISO 8601` inspired format
- `sha256.go` is a wrapper on the `crypto/sha256` library for easily producing hashes

## Commons Package

The `commons` package includes Prometheus metrics and configuration files essential for gateway operations.

### Config

Environment variables are used to configure the gateway.
In the future configuration may be moved to the database or a config file.
Current environment variables are:
- **SHUTDOWN_DELAY**: How long to wait for processes to finish on graceful shutdown (default: 5sec)
- **JOB_BUFFER_SIZE**: How many worker tasks to buffer before blocking (default: 50)
- **NUM_WORKERS**: How many goroutines to run to process the job buffer (default: 10)
- **PROXY_TO**: Internal URL to gateway server
- **HOST**: Domain this is hosted on, used to extract chain name from subdomain
- **PORT**: Network port for server to listen on (default: 9000)
- **DATABASE_URL**: Postgres connection URL
- **REDIS_URL**: Redis connection URL, alternative to decomposed vars
- **REDIS_ADDR**: Host of redis server
- **REDIS_USER**: Redis username
- **REDIS_PASSWORD**: Redis password
- **INSTRUMENT_ENABLED**: Debugging feature flag to add instrumentation
- **LOG_LEVEL**: How verbose should logs be (default: INFO)

### Worker Pool

To avoid random goroutines being managed throughout the code, there is a task queue to coordinate asynchronous jobs.
Implement the `Runnable` interface and add to the queue for a job runner to pick it up.
Set the environment variables described above to increase or decrease the queue size and number of workers based on needs. 

### Healthcheck

There is a healthcheck endpoint exposed at `/health` which reports on the status of the gateway proxy.
Any external service can be monitored by adding its health to this service.
In addition, any internal metrics that should cause infrastructure to respond in some way can also be added.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is used for tracking metrics. It is exposed with a `/metrics` endpoint.
In addition to the common metrics, we add:
- **EndpointUsage**: A counter for usage on each endpoint, used for reporting
- **JobGauge**: Shows the current size of the job queue, used for monitoring
- **LatencyHistogram**: Instrumentation to show how much latency is added by the proxy process
- **RateLimitGauge**: Notifications that a rate limit has been hit, resets when resolved
