# PORTERS Integration with POKT

We are using a script by Nodies for the app stakes, which can be found [here](https://github.com/baaspoolsllc/pokt-stake-apps-script).
It is a simple node script, which walks you through the app stake process.

## Prompts

- POKT node, URL of the node the script is going to call to stake
- Chain IDs, a comma separated list of the chains you intend to stake to
    - this can be a list of one to fifteen chain IDs
- selector for POKT Mainnet and POKT Testnet (y/n)
- amount of POKT to stake per private key
    - number of relays available are split evenly across all chains staked

Thereafter, the script verifies the prompts.
The script then runs the transaction on the POKT network to stake.
