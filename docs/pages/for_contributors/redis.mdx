# Redis Data Store

The Redis data store is located between the gateway and the postgres server. Thus, it is a local cache for the information described in the schema.

It is important to note that there is one postgres instance, but one Redis instance per region, so that there is a local copy that can be quickly read from or written to.

Due to this setup, individual Redis instances may differ slightly, but are synced eventually. This is achieved because the only write from the Redis data store to the postgres instance is `append only`.
Hence, no conflicts are possible between instances.

For example, given two users of the same app are in two regions, they both will be accessing different Redis instances.
However, their usage will be reflected in the postgres instance eventually.
