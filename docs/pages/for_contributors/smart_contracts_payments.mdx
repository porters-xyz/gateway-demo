# Smart Contracts

## ERC-20 Token `PORTR`

It is a standard ERC-20 smart contract with a few additions, namely:

- open `mint()` with a fixed price, which is maintained by Chainlink.
    - the smart contract on Taiko Mainnet is using Pyth data feed through the Chainlink interface
    - it allows for minting by sending the native token as the payable, the rate of which is set by the Chainlink price feed
- `adminMint()` is only called by the owner to mint without having to pay
    - this is used for internal usage and enterprise-onboarding
- `applyToAccount()` used for adding balance to a tenant
    - initiates a burn and emits an event, which is used to increase the account balance within the gateway
- `sweep()` and `sweepToken()`
    - allows the operator to withdraw token balances of the contract, both native and ERC-20, or settling internal accounts
    - this enables coverage of POKT relay costs
    - it completes the lifecycle of the smart contract

## Pyth Integration

The Taiko deployment of the smart contract has a dependency of the Pyth wrapper for Chainlink.
It has been deployed by us, but the code-base is not maintained by PORTERS.
The wrapper is then connected to our implementation as the price feed for minting.

A [script](https://github.com/porters-xyz/gateway-demo/blob/develop/contracts/script/02_Pyth.s.sol) for deploying this wrapper exists and has to be modified for deploying any other price feed (currently ETH/USD).
