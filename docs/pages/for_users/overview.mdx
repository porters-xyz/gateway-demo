## What is PORTERS
RaidGuild, leveraging its extensive experience in understanding the needs of blockchain developers and ensuring client satisfaction, has developed PORTERS â€“ a sovereign RPC gateway on POKT. 

Rooted in the DePIN movement, PORTERS provides the first RPC gateway created by Web3 developers for Web3 developers, continuing RaidGuild's legacy of leading Web3 out of the dark ages.

PORTERS simplifies connecting projects to POKT's powerful DePIN network by abstracting away protocol complexities, offering a developer-centric, plug-and-play experience that facilitates 
collaboration and sharing without compromising security. With scalable and robust developer tooling, PORTERS allows for flexible RPC usage adjustments, ensuring smooth data availability and 
API key management. Additionally, PORTERS eliminates the need for traditional funding ramps, enabling users to swap their favorite tokens for PORTERS and instantly fund their RPC endpoint 
with no credit card required, no hidden fees, and no vendor lock-in.
